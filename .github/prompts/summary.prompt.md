You have done a lot of great work, now it is time to summarize the changes you have made, and educate me about what you have done, and why you have done it, and what's the highlights about the changes you have made or the techinical decisions you have taken, what's the beauty of the code you have written, and what are the things that you are proud of, and what are the things that you think can be improved in the future.

I just want to learn from you and understand the changes you have made, so please be as detailed as possible. In the AI era, I want to learn from the AI, not just get the code.
