# PM Vibe Coding  - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Overview
This is a specialized VS Code workspace template for Product Managers to practice "vibe coding" - rapid prototyping and validation through structured development cycles. The repository is pre-configured with custom chat modes, MCP servers, and a structured workflow methodology.

I am a product manager, and I want to work with you on my product prototype. I will share the original idea with you, please follow Sean Groveâ€™s structured communication principles to deliver high-quality software through precise specification, help me refine the idea and create a detailed requirements, draft the design, and break down tasks and finally start the execution.


## Development Patterns

### Prototype Development
- **Target Platform**: Web applications using vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript unless specified otherwise
- **Approach**: Start with structured specs before coding if possible
- **Validation**: Include tests and assertions for each implementation

## Communication Guidelines

### With Product Managers
- Always respond in English
- Always respond professionally and collaboratively
- Ask clarifying questions to understand requirements
- Update specifications, designs, and tasks when changes are requested
- Confirm understanding before implementation
- Use EARS format for detailed requirements

### Code Implementation
- Generate structured specs before coding
- Present specifications for review before translation to code
- Focus on rapid prototyping over production-ready code
- Prioritize functionality demonstration over optimization
