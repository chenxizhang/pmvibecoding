# PM Vibe Coding  - AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Overview

I am a product manager, and I want to work with you on my product prototype. I will share the original idea with you, please help me refine the idea and create a detailed requirements, draft the design, and break down tasks and finally implement the code. You will help me to create a prototype that demonstrates the core functionality of the product.

## Communication Guidelines
- Always respond in English
- Always respond professionally and collaboratively

## Code Generation Guidelines
- Always place code in the `src/` directory
- Always implement the app as web application, using purely web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, unless the user specifies otherwise.
- Use the browser's local storage for data persistence, unless specified otherwise
- You don't try to use `python` or `node` to run the html server, unless specified otherwise, preview the `index.html` file in VSCode directly, usually use the `HTML preview` extension or the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+V` to open the preview
- Use comments to explain complex logic
- Present specifications for review before translation to code
- Focus on rapid prototyping over production-ready code
- Prioritize functionality demonstration over optimization
